    <introduction>
    <html:div>
The Accessibility Tools Framework (ACTF) is an incubation phase project that is a subproject of the Eclipse Technology Project.<html:br/>
ACTF is a framework that serves as an extensible infrastructure upon which developers can build a variety of utilities 
that help to evaluate and enhance the accessibility of applications and content for people with disabilities. 
A collection of example utilities will also be provided which were created on top of the framework such as compliance validation tools, 
assistive technology simulation applications, usability visualization tools, unit-testing utilities, and alternative accessible interfaces for applications.

     For M7, we plan to be functionally complete. After RC1 is released, builds will be produced weekly until the release.
     In the RC phase only bugs marked P2 or higher or severity major or higher will be fixed. 
     APIs will not change except to address critical issues, until RC3, at which point APIs will be frozen.
