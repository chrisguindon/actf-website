    <introduction>
    <html:div>
The Accessibility Tools Framework (ACTF) is an incubation phase project that is a subproject of the Eclipse Technology Project.<html:br/>
ACTF is a framework that serves as an extensible infrastructure upon which developers can build a variety of utilities that help to evaluate and enhance the accessibility of applications and content for people with disabilities. A collection of example utilities will also be provided which were created on top of the framework such as compliance validation tools, assistive technology simulation applications, usability visualization tools, unit-testing utilities, and alternative accessible interfaces for applications.
